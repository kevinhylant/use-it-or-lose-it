# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately

# If you are working with associations, you can simply define a reference node between two different fixtures. Here's an example with a belongs_to/has_many association:

# # In fixtures/categories.yml
# about:
#   name: About
 
# # In fixtures/articles.yml
# one:
#   title: Welcome to Rails!
#   body: Hello world!
#   category: about

# USE RUBY TO GENERATE SAMPLE DATA

#   username: <%= "user#{n}" %>
#   email: <%= "user#{n}@example.com" %>
# <% end %>
